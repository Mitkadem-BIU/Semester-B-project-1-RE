### Readme File

1. This program's project is made to simulating a short segment of an airplane flight, showing its control bar in sync with the location of the plane. In addition to that, multiple graphs that show corellations between variables like time, speed, elevator, ruttle ,etc. By inserting 2 relevant CSV files, one for normal learning and one for anomaly detection respectively, the program can fullfill its purposes.

2. The project files are divided into three folders: models, view models and views. That was done in order to represent the files in the same order of the flow of information of the program. Main CS files are MainControllerModel... (help!)
